description: Maw Prints is a side project that is particularly close to my heart. It showcases playful prints on paper and textiles. I used the physics engine Matter.js to translate the aesthetic of the prints into an interactive screen arrangement on which the shapes can be dragged and dropped. Likewise, the menu breaks up from its fixed form and moves freely on the screen.
