description: '„Fast, fast, fast, cheap, cheap, cheap, now, now, now“ – the Body Loom System offers an alternative model to the mantra of Fast Fashion, and equally reflects upon the ever-accelerating cycles of the fashion industry. In this case, time plays an integral role. This work consciously removes itself from an industrial, mass-market context, and instead places the focus on the traditional craft of hand-weaving.
The central objective was to develop an apparatus, which is comparable to a loom, and enables the seamless weaving of a three-dimensional form in one piece.
As the garment is fully manufactured in one stage, there is no need for cutting and sewing. A one hundred percent Zero-Waste-Product is produced, which perfectly fits the given body shape.
The actual product is the three-dimensional loom, which can be ordered via an online system, and arrives as a DIY assembly kit, pre-fabricated to one’s individual body dimensions. It is a kind of tool which is generated virtually, and combines new technology with an ancient textile craft.'
