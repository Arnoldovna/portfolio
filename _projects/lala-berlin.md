description: 'As the former Textile Print Designer at Lala Berlin, a renowned womenâ€˜s fashion brand, I was responsible for textile print artwork development (t-shirt print, accessories, seasonal prints, print on knit and tech gadgets).
Besides the creative development of the collection I also executed technical print strike-offs.
In my time at Lala Berlin I finalized two collections AW18/19 under the design supervision of Yolanda Zobel, SS19 under Claudia Bothe, and a part of AW19/20 under Carsten Fielitz.'
