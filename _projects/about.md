After working in fashion as a textile print designer at pattern powerhouse <a href="https://www.lalaberlin.com/" alt="Lala Berlin">Lala Berlin</a>, I started building a second mainstay in the realm of web development which led me to my previous job as a Frontend Development Trainee at <a href="https://www.edenspiekermann.com/eu/" alt="Edenspiekermann">Edenspiekermann</a>, where I’ve been lucky enough to work for clients such as — die Gruenen Bündnis´90, Parma, IAS-Gruppe, SAP Innovationcenter, Schrot&Korn and Biohandel. <br><br>
In my free time, I like to create projects that reflect my interests in colour and craftsmanship. <br>
